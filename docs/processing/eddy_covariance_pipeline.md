# Eddy Covariance Processing Pipeline

The **Eddy Covariance (EC)** branch of the processing system.

## Scope & overview

- High-frequency (typically 10 Hz) EC data
- Half-hour segmentation
- Flux calculation using EddyPro
- Post-processing and filtering prior to archiving

## Notes

- Instrument-specific details (e.g., IRGASON, CSAT3, LI-7500) are handled upstream
- The core EddyPro flux calculation itself is external to the MATLAB `db_*` system
- Outputs are synchronized with FG products for unified archiving
