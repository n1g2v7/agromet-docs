# Automation and Task Scheduler

Daily processing is orchestrated using **Windows Task Scheduler**.
Each scheduled task launches a batch (`.bat`) file that in turn calls
Python or MATLAB scripts.

## Scheduled Daily Tasks Overview

## Design rationale

- Data ingestion is separated from scientific processing
- Failures in one site do not block others
- Logs are written for traceability and recovery



!!! note "Data Transfer Details"

    For detailed information on how data are transferred from field sites
    (Google Drive API, Dropbox, DriveHQ, and hybrid systems), including
    workflows and pseudocode, see:
